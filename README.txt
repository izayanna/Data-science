PRONENESS TO SURVIVAL
This pipeline was written in Python and run properly in Python 3.10. This was developed using machine learning tools to provide a selection of the features that are more correlated to survival to breast cancer, and also provide a guide for diagnostics based on the patient features and give a more realistic life expectation using machine learning classification.
This pipeline was developed using a breast cancer dataset, but could be applied to datasets from other kinds of diseases.
To run this pipeline:
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Download the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric?select=METABRIC_RNA_Mutation.csv and also the script available in this repository and keep those files in the same folder.
3. Before start running this pipeline (Run> Run data_science.py), be aware of editing the pipeline changing the respective file paths according to the folder in which you have your files saved.
4. If you use a different dataset, please be aware of changing the corresponding names in the pipeline.
